# Bootstrap Interactive

In this activity we will update a static landing page to make use of some of Bootstrap's Interactive JavaScript components.

## Instructions

- Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your web browser and take a moment to examine the page.

- Now refer back to the last of Bootstrap JavaScript components discussed in the previous activity and update the page to implement a few of those. 

- At a minimum, attempt to include:

  - A Carousel

  - A Scrollspy

  - A Modal

  - A Dismissible Alert

  - A Collapse Element

- Feel free to modify, add, or remove any part of the existing web page you'd like in order to achieve this.

- While the goal of this activity is to use as many Bootstrap JavaScript components as possible, attempt to do so in a meaningful way.

### Hints

- See the [Bootstrap Component Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/)

### Bonus

- Once you've added the required components, attempt to add the rest of Bootstrap's JavaScript components.
