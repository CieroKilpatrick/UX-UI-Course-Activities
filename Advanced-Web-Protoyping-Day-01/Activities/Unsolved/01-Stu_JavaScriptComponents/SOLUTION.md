# JavaScript Components

- Once time's up call on a few students to share a few JavaScript components they've identified and their behavior.

- Below are some examples, briefly go through any unfamiliar components together as a class and discuss.

  - [**Dismissible Alerts**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/#dismissing): Bootstrap alert components which can be "dismissed" or made to fade away by clicking a button within the alert.

  - [**Carousel**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/carousel/): A slideshow component for cycling through elements — images or slides of text — like a carousel.

  - [**Collapse**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/collapse/): Used to toggle the visibility of content by shrinking or expanding it in and out of view.

  - [**Dropdowns**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/): Used to toggle contextual overlays for displaying links

  - [**Modals**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/modal/): Used to add pop-up dialogs to your site which can contain virtually any content.

  - [**Popovers**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/popovers/): Can be added to any element to toggle tiny overlays that contain text when clicked — similar to those found in iOS.

  - [**Scrollspy**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/scrollspy): Used to automatically update a Bootstrap navigation or list group component to indicate the link that's currently active in the viewport as the user scrolls.

  - [**Tooltips**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/tooltips/): Similar to popovers, tooltips can be added to any element to toggle even smaller overlays containing text.
